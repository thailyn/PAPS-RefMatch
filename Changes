Revision history for PAPS-RefMatch

  New features:
    - Get and use an appropriate persona from the database, so changes are
      correctly attributed to this script, and the correct version of it.
      Getting this persona requires fetching the correct user and algorithm
      from the database.  If these or fetching the persona fails (e.g., they
      do not exist, the script will die with an error message.
    - When fetching work references without a referenced work id, fetch those
      that either do not have a guess, or have a guess by this algorithm.
      Known issue: this query does not return work references that have a
      guess by a different algorithm, irrespective of whether this algorithm
      has made a guess or not.
    - Only write the first suitable work reference reference text to a file to
      be parsed by ParsCit.  Always use the first valid citation ParsCit
      returns.
    - Update or create the referenced work guess in the database.  Use the
      current timestamp for the last_checked value.
    - Only print out various debugging information when in 'verbose' mode.
      This mode cannot be set via the command line and must be set inside the
      script.  Normal use should not need the verbose mode.
    - Include additional metadata about the work and the work reference before
      and after searching for the best match.
  Bug fixes:
    - Enable UTF-8 in the connection with the database, so UTF-8 characters in
      reference text is interpreted correctly.
    - Use a hash reference in the WorkReference search condition.  Using a
      hash for this parameter is deprecated.
    - Check that a citation's text is non-null before trying to compute its
      length.  If ParsCit could not determine the citation's title, the
      getTitle accessor returns a null value.
    - If ParsCit does not find a citation in the reference text, create a
      dummy citation whose string and title are equal to the full reference
      text.
  Other:
    - Added the "use utf8" pragma, so the script is interpreted as using the
      UTF-8 encoding.

  Other:
    - Fixed line endings.
    - Future stable versions will be even numbers.  Odd version numbers will
      be reserved for unstable versions.

  New features:
    - Initial version of PAPS-RefMatch.  Fetches all works and all references
      without a referenced work id.  Writes the text of each of these
      references to a file, and parses them with ParsCit.  Picks a random
      citation that was parsed, and compares it against the display name of
      each work, using the Levenshtein distance algorithm.  The display name
      that is the closest match is saved, and its comparison against the
      selected reference is printed.
    - Includes two version of the Levenshtein distance algorithm.  The
      'levenshtein_distance' subroutine simply computes the distance between
      two strings and returns it.  The 'levenshtein_distance_detailed'
      computes the distance, as well, but also keeps track of which changes
      must be done to convert one of the strings into the other.  This
      conversion is stored as a set of strings, which, when printed
      vertically, correctly lines up both input strings, respecting insertions
      and substitutions.  Both versions of the algorithm use the
      "no warnings 'recursion'" pragma to avoid warning messages when the
      recursive calls reach sufficient depth.
